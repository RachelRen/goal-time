## webpack 配置

[webpack](https://github.com/wanliyunyan/dva-typescript-antd-starter-kit/blob/master/build/webpack.base.js)

In this post we're improving build speeds with TypeScript and webpack in 3 ways:

1. fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin — With this plugin in play ts-loader only performs transpilation. ts-loader is doing less so the build is faster.
2. HappyPack — With HappyPack in the mix, the build is parallelised. That parallelisation means the build is faster.
3. thread-loader / cache-loader — With thread-loader and cache-loader, again the build is parallelised and the build is faster and the config is simpler.
